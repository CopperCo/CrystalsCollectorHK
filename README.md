Here is another in browser game which will dynamically update your HTML pages with the jQuery library. This game was initally built using Bootstrap although I have updated it to use the Semantic UI framework.

## Tools Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Semantic UI
- Vanilla JavaScript
- jQuery

## How to Play:

Every day the cost of gems changes. When you start the game the cost of gems you have to meet will be displayed.

There are 4 gems, by clicking on a gem the cost assoicated will be shown in your Gem Cost section. For each gem you click the cost will add up.

## How to win!

You win the game by mathcing your total cost with the cost of the day which is randomly generated.
You lose the game if your total cost goes above the daily cost.
